# 01-02 | Graphing Stuff

1. Create project folder, index, and script
1. Add `<DOCTYPE>` and `<meta>` tags this time as well as `lang` attribute in the `<html>` tag
1. Add a link to Neogebra and `script.js`
    1. Explain all that Neogebra does is add shortcuts for stuff we have done or will do
1. Create `canvas` and `ctx` vars
1. ctx.flip()
    1. Explain that this scales and translates the y axis like we did last lesson
1. Make new function `f`
    1. They should be familiar with function from last unit
    1. Explain how it's just like a math function
        1. `return x` is the same thing as saying y=x
1. Make the `for` loop depicted
    1. Explain why it's going through the canvas width
1. fillRect as depicted for f(x) in for loop
1. Make new function `g`
1. fillRect in similar fashion but for g(x) in for loop
    1. Should result in crappy looking x^2 function
    1. Explain why
        1. Plotting points at increments of 1 on x
1. Add beginPath() and moveTo()
1. Add lineTo() in the for loop for g(x)
1. strokePath() after for loop
1. Play around with shifting `g` around the graph
    1. Depicted in comments in `g`
